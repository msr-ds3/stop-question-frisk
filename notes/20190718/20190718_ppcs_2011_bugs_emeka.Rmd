* reclassfied contact screening for the PPCS 2011 data and number of 
observations went up from 3000 to 7000+ and the proportions of the merged
datset improved significantly

* fixed 2011 type of incident data (street stop, traffic stop were redefined)

* added a new column for officer split race in 2002 and 2005 PPCS data 
(need to do the same with 1996, 1999, 2008, and 2011)

*** NEED TO FIX 2011
