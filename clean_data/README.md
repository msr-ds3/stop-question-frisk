# Clean Data

All clean data files for the project should go in this directory. They should be derived from files in the `../raw_data/` directory. To avoid committing large files to the repository, we'll store large files elsewhere and keep scripts to download the data and/or pointers to paths where the data are stored. Document each script or pointer below.
